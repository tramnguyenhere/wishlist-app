# Wishlist application - Christmas 2022 edition.

Each e-commerce platform has its own version of wishlist; therefore, to gather all of the wishes in a one place, I developed a personal wishlist application from scratch. The current version is only for personal usage which only me could add wishes and edit them, my friends and relatives could see the list, get where to buy and mark it as an "already bought" gift.
